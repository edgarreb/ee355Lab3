Lab: 3

Things to note: 
In this lab I used the stoi() function call to convert strings to integers. I used this function to convert the "sizes" of pancakes when reading from the input file. 

All the contents read from the file were stored in two arrays. The first array held the size of pancakes, and is named size[]. The second array held the value boolean value that would indicate the burnt side of the pancake, this array was called burnt[];

Before filling the arrays (burnt[], size[]) I would store the values from the input file in temprorary arrays of type string.

Concerns: 
I was able to verify my results matched the golden output, however I ran into some issues with the script. I emailed Saeed about this concern, but I have not heard back from him yet. To avoid a late submission I decided to submit without running the script. The error that I was running into when running the script was stoi() not defined. I believe this error is due to the fact that the script compiles my code it doesn't use -std=c++11 as the compiler option. To test further I made my own test.txt file to run my code on, and verified that it worked. I will be pushing the file "test.txt" to the repo so that you can have access to it. If you have any questions feel free to email me.
